.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
It is a basic command interpreter, taking the arguments from the standard 
input or a file and executing the commands to display them on the standard 
output. 
This shell works as a command interpreter in two modes:
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
.TP
In this mode, the shell takes the commands from the standard input, executes them and gets ready to read another command-line.
.TP
.B Non-interactive Mode
.TP
This mode reads the commands from a file sent thru a pipe, the commands will be executed and the shell won't ask for more.
